# CS50 psets

[CS50 is an outstanding resource](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) which makes the fundementals of computer science available to everyone, for free. Hats off to Harvard, EDX and everyone involved in putting together such an outstanding resource.

This repo is where I'm storing my personal progress on the course, which I'm taking in 2018. In the spirit of [academic honesty](https://docs.cs50.net/2017/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty), I would encourage you to not look if you're also taking the course or looking to enrol.

You should enrol. It's ace.
